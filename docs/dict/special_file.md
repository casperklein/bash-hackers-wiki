# Special file

Unlike a regular file (a bunch of accessible data organized on a
filesystem), it's a special filename that points to a ressource or
similar:

-   character special files
-   block special files
-   named pipes
-   socket files

Since a directory also is only a file, you can count it as special file,
too.
