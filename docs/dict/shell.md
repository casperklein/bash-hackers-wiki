# Shell

On UNIX(r), the shell is the main interaction tool between the
user-level and the system. That doesn't necessarily mean the user
always sits infront of a shell, but it's integral part of the system,
not only an \"optional commandline interpreter\".

The main job of a shell is to execute commands as a user requests them.
This behaviour alone doesn't help much. A shell knits some intelligence
and flow control around the possibility to execute commands - it's a
complete commandline-oriented user-interface (UI).
