# Symlink

A symlink (symbolic link) is a \"normal\" file, which contains a pointer
to another filename. Since it really only points to another **filename**
it can

-   reference filenames on other filesystems
-   reference filenames that don't actually exist
-   save a reference to the name of a directory
